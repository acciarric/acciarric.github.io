Welcome to my HomePage!

I am an Italian mathematician and currently I am an Associate Professor, (with ASN qualification as "[professore di prima fascia](https://asn21.cineca.it/pubblico/miur/esito-abilitato/01%252FA2/1/4) in 01/MATH-02 Algebra e Geometria") at the [Department of Physics, Informatics and Mathematics](https://www.fim.unimore.it/it) of the [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia](https://www.unimore.it/)- Italy.

I received my Bachelor and Master degrees in Mathematics at the [Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Roma "La Sapienza"](http://www.uniroma1.it) (Italy). Then I moved to the [Università degli Studi di L'Aquila](http://www.univaq.it/) for my PhD degree, and I spent two years at the [Universidad del País Vasco/Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea](http://www.ehu.es/) (Spain) working in collaboration with my PhD supervisor [Gustavo Fernández-Alcober](https://ekoizpen-zientifikoa.ehu.eus/investigadores/128893/detalle). 

After obtained my PhD degree in 2010, I moved to Brasilia to work in collaboration with [Pavel Shumyatsky](https://mat.unb.br/index.php/pessoas/docentes/57-pavel-shumyatsky). First I was  a post-doctoral researcher holding a CNPq fellowship from 2011 to 2013 at [Universidade de Brasília](http://www.unb.br/) (UnB - Brazil). Later on, from January 2013 until December 2024, I was a "Professor Adjunto" at the [Department of Mathematics](https://mat.unb.br) of the University of Brasilia, on leave without paying during the period 01/2022 - 12/2024. I also was a recipient of a [CNPq](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br) Research Productivity (PQ-2) fellowship from 2015 until 2022.  During the academic year 2017 I spent a sabbatical year, as a CAPES visiting professor fellow, at the [Department of Mathematics of the University of Padua](http://www.math.unipd.it/en/) and worked in collaboration with [Andrea Lucchini](http://www.math.unipd.it/~lucchini/). 

 From November 2021 until October 2024 I was a tenure track - Assistant Professor (Ricercatore RTDb) at the Department of Physics, Informatics and Mathematics of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.
