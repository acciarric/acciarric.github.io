  abstract={By a coprime commutator in a profinite group \(G\) we mean any element of the form \([x, y]\), where \(x,y\in G\) and \((|x|,|y|)=1\). It is well-known that the subgroup generated by the coprime commutators of \(G\) is precisely the pronilpotent residual \(\gamma_\infty(G)\). 
  There are several recent works showing that finiteness conditions on the set of coprime commutators have strong impact on the properties of \(\gamma_\infty(G)\) and, more generally, on the structure of \(G\). In this paper we show that if the set of coprime commutators of a profinite 
  group \(G\) is covered by countably many procyclic subgroups, then \(\gamma_\infty(G)\) is finite-by-procyclic. In particular, it follows that \(G\) is finite-by-pronilpotent-by-abelian.},

  We produce examples showing that such a result does not hold without the assumption of \(p\)-solubility.

  We also prove that if \(G\) is a finite group such that for every prime \(p\) dividing \(|G|\) for any Sylow \(p\)-subgroup \(P\),  any subgroup generated by a subset of \(I_G(P)\) can be generated by \(r\) elements, then the derived subgroup \(G'\) has \(r\)-bounded rank. As an important tool in the proofs, we prove the following result, which is also of independent interest: if a finite group \(G\) admits a group of 
  coprime automorphisms \(A\) such that any subgroup generated by a subset of \(I_G(A)\) is \(r\)-generated, then the rank of \([G,A]\) is \(r\)-bounded.},

  abstract={A group-word \(w\) is concise in a class of groups \(\mathcal X\) if and only if the verbal subgroup \(w(G)\) is finite whenever \(w\) takes only finitely many values in a group \(G\in \mathcal X\). It is a long-standing open problem whether every word is concise in residually finite groups. 
  In this paper we observe that the conciseness of a word \(w\) in residually finite groups is equivalent to that in the class of virtually pro-\(p\) groups.
  This is used to show that if \(q,n\) are positive integers and \(w\) is a multilinear commutator word, then the words \(w^q\) and \([w^q,_{n} y]\) are concise in residually finite groups. Earlier this was known only in the case where \(q\) is a prime power.
  In the course of the proof we establish that certain classes of groups satisfying the law \(w^q\equiv1\), or \([\delta_k^q,{}_n\, y]\equiv1\), are varieties.},

 abstract={Let \(w\) be a group-word. Suppose that the set of all \(w\)-values in a profinite group \(G\) is contained in a union of countably many subgroups. 
 It is natural to ask in what way the structure of the verbal subgroup \(w(G)\) depends on the properties of the covering subgroups. 
 The present article is a survey of recent results related to that question. In particular we survey results on finite and countable coverings of word-values 
 (mostly commutators) by procyclic, abelian, nilpotent, and soluble subgroups, as well as subgroups with finiteness conditions. 
 The last section of the paper is devoted to relation of the described results with Hall's problem on conciseness of group-words.

 abstract={The coprime commutators \(\gamma_j^*\) and \(\delta_j^*\) were recently introduced  as a tool to study properties of finite groups that can be expressed in terms of commutators of elements of coprime orders. 
 They are defined as follows.  Let \(G\) be a finite group. Every element of \(G\) is  both a \(\gamma_1^*\)-commutator and a \(\delta_0^*\)-commutator. Now let \(j\geq 2\) and let \(X\) be the set of all elements of \(G\) that are powers of \(\gamma_{j-1}^*\)-commutators. 
 An element \(g\) is a \(\gamma_j^*\)-commutator if there exist \(a\in X\) and \(b\in G\) such that \(g=[a,b]\) and \((|a|,|b|)=1\).
 For \(j\geq 1\) let \(Y\) be the set of all elements of \(G\) that are powers of \(\delta_{j-1}^*\)-commutators. The element \(g\) is a \(\delta_j^*\)-commutator if there exist \(a,b\in Y\) such that \(g=[a,b]\) and \((|a|,|b|)=1\).
 The subgroups of $G$ generated by all \(\gamma_j^*\)-commutators and all  \(\delta_j^*\)-commutators are denoted by \(\gamma_j^*(G)\) and \(\delta_j^*(G)\), respectively. For every \(j\geq2\) the subgroup \(\gamma_j^*(G)\) is precisely the last term of the lower central series of
 \(G\) (which throughout the paper is denoted by \(\gamma_\infty(G)\)) while for every \(j\geq1\) the subgroup \(\delta_j^*(G)\) is precisely the last term of the lower central series of \(\delta_{j-1}^*(G)\), that is, \(\delta_j^*(G)=\gamma_\infty(\delta_{j-1}^*(G))\).
 In the present paper we prove that if \(G\) possesses \(m\) cyclic subgroups whose union contains all \(\gamma_j^*\)-commutators of \(G\), then \(\gamma_j^*(G)\) contains a subgroup \(\Delta\), of \(m\)-bounded order, which is normal in \(G\) and has the property that \(\gamma_{j}^{*}(G)/\Delta\) is cyclic. 
 If \(j\geq2\) and \(G\) possesses \(m\) cyclic subgroups whose union contains all \(\delta_j^*\)-commutators of \(G\), then the order of \(\delta_j^*(G)\) is \(m\)-bounded.},

 abstract={A group-word \(w\) is called concise if whenever the set of \(w\)-values in a group \(G\)
  is finite it always follows that the verbal subgroup \(w(G)\,\) is finite. More generally, a word \(w\,\) is said to be concise in a class of groups \(X\,\) if whenever the set of \(w\,\)-values is finite for a group \(G\in X\,\), it always follows that \(w(G)\,\) is finite. P. Hall asked whether every word is concise. Due to Ivanov the answer to this problem is known to be negative. Dan Segal asked whether every word is concise in the class of residually finite groups. In this direction we prove that if \(w\,\) is a multilinear commutator and \(q\,\) is a prime-power, then the word \(w^q\,\) is indeed concise in the class of residually finite groups. Further, we show that in the case where \(w=\gamma_k\,\) the word \(w^q\,\) is boundedly concise in the class of residually finite groups. It remains unknown whether the word \(w^q\,\) is actually concise in the class of all groups.}

 abstract={We introduce the concept of a double automorphism of an \(A\)-graded Lie algebra \(L\). Roughly, this is an automorphism of \(L\) which also induces an automorphism of the group \(A\). It is clear that the set of all double automorphisms of \(L\) forms a subgroup in \(Aut\, L\). In the present paper we prove several nilpotency criteria for a graded Lie algebra admitting a finite group of double automorphisms. 
 One of the obtained results is as follows. Let \(A\) be a torsion-free abelian group and \(L\) an \(A\)-graded Lie algebra in which \([L,\underbrace{L_0,\ldots,L_0}_{k}]=0\). Assume that \(L\) admits a finite group of double automorphisms \(H\) such that \(C_A(h)=0\) for all nontrivial \(h\in H\) and \(C_L(H)\) is nilpotent of class \(c\). Then \(L\) is nilpotent and the class of \(L\) is bounded in terms of \(|H|\), \(k\) and \(c\) only.
 We also give an application of our results to groups admitting a Frobenius group of automorphisms.},
