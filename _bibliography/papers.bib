  abstract={For a subgroup \(S\) of a group \(G\), let \(I_G(S)\) denote the set of commutators \([g,s]=g^{-1}g^s\), where \(g\in G\) and \(s\in S\), so that \([G,S]\) is the subgroup generated by \(I_G(S)\). 
  We prove that if \(G\) is a  \(p\)-soluble finite group with a Sylow \(p\)-subgroup \(P\) such that any subgroup generated by a subset of \(I_G(P)\) is \(r\)-generated, then \([G,P]\) has \(r\)-bounded rank. 
  We produce examples showing that such a result does not hold without the assumption of \(p\)-solubility. Instead, we prove that if  a finite group \(G\) has a Sylow  \(p\)-subgroup \(P\) such that (a)  any subgroup generated by a subset of \(I_G(P)\) is \(r\)-generated,  and (b) for any \(x\in I_G(P)\), any subgroup generated by a subset of \(I_G(x)\) is \(r\)-generated, then \([G,P]\) has \(r\)-bounded rank. 
  We also prove that if \(G\) is a finite group such that for every prime \(p\) dividing \(|G|\) for any Sylow \(p\)-subgroup \(P\),  any subgroup generated by a subset of \(I_G(P)\) can be generated by \(r\) elements, then the derived subgroup \(G'\) has \(r\)-bounded rank. As an important tool in the proofs, we prove the following result, which is also of independent interest: if a finite group \(G\) admits a group of 
  coprime automorphisms \(A\) such that any subgroup generated by a subset of \(I_G(A)\) is \(r\)-generated, then the rank of \([G,A]\) is \(r\)-bounded.},

  abstract={A group-word \(w\) is concise in a class of groups \(\mathcal X\) if and only if the verbal subgroup \(w(G)\) is finite whenever \(w\) takes only finitely many values in a group \(G\in \mathcal X\). It is a long-standing open problem whether every word is concise in residually finite groups. 
  In this paper we observe that the conciseness of a word \(w\) in residually finite groups is equivalent to that in the class of virtually pro-\(p\) groups.
  This is used to show that if \(q,n\) are positive integers and \(w\) is a multilinear commutator word, then the words \(w^q\) and \([w^q,_{n} y]\) are concise in residually finite groups. Earlier this was known only in the case where \(q\) is a prime power.
  In the course of the proof we establish that certain classes of groups satisfying the law \(w^q\equiv1\), or \([\delta_k^q,{}_n\, y]\equiv1\), are varieties.},

 abstract={A group-word \(w\) is called concise if whenever the set of \(w\)-values in a group \(G\)
  is finite it always follows that the verbal subgroup \(w(G)\,\) is finite. More generally, a word \(w\,\) is said to be concise in a class of groups \(X\,\) if whenever the set of \(w\,\)-values is finite for a group \(G\in X\,\), it always follows that \(w(G)\,\) is finite. P. Hall asked whether every word is concise. Due to Ivanov the answer to this problem is known to be negative. Dan Segal asked whether every word is concise in the class of residually finite groups. In this direction we prove that if \(w\,\) is a multilinear commutator and \(q\,\) is a prime-power, then the word \(w^q\,\) is indeed concise in the class of residually finite groups. Further, we show that in the case where \(w=\gamma_k\,\) the word \(w^q\,\) is boundedly concise in the class of residually finite groups. It remains unknown whether the word \(w^q\,\) is actually concise in the class of all groups.}

If \(w\) is an outer commutator word, we prove that \(P\cap w(G)\) is

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
