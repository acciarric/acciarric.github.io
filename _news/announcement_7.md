I am so glad to announce that  the inauguration ceremony of the exhibition “[Ritratti di Matematiche dal mondo](https://www.ritrattidimatematiche.unimore.it/): un progetto partecipativo tra mostre, laboratori e attività per scuole e cittadinanza” took place on Thursday, 27 November 2025 at 5:00 PM at the ER-GO University Residence San Filippo Neri in Modena.

The initiative, a Public Engagement project, promoted by the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and the  Department of Physics, Computer Science and Mathematics at UNIMORE with the patronage of several associations, brings to Modena for the first time the international exhibition [Women of Mathematics from around the World – A Gallery of Portraits](https://womeninmath.net). It is a visual and narrative journey intertwining science and life, with the goal of highlighting the presence of women in mathematical research and promoting scientific culture from an inclusive perspective.

The project is organized in two phases: after the exhibition at the Residence San Filippo Neri (27 November – 11 December 2025), it will continue at the Mathematics Building of the Department of Physics, Computer Science and Mathematics at UNIMORE (February – March 2026) with workshops and activities for local schools.
