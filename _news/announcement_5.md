Thrilling News! Next September 2025 I will spend two weeks at [ICTP - Trieste](https://www.ictp.it) in the frame of the [Research in Pairs 2025 programme](https://www.ictp.it/opportunity/ictp-indam-collaborative-grants-and-research-pairs-2025-0) jointly with [Pavel Shumyatsky](https://mat.unb.br/index.php/pessoas/docentes/57-pavel-shumyatsky). My thanks go to ICTP and [INdAM](https://www.altamatematica.it) for the collaborative grant. Looking forward to that new experience!
